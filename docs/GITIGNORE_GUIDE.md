# Git Ignore Guide

**File:** `.gitignore`
**Purpose:** Prevent unnecessary files from being tracked in version control
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-16

---

## Overview

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude files and directories that don't need to be version controlled. This keeps the repository clean, reduces size, and prevents tracking of generated artifacts, sensitive files, and temporary data.

---

## What's EXCLUDED (Don't Track)

### Python & Virtual Environments
- `__pycache__/` - Python bytecode cache
- `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyd` - Compiled Python files
- `venv/`, `env/`, `.venv` - Virtual environment directories
- `.eggs/`, `*.egg-info/` - Package build artifacts
- `build/`, `dist/` - Distribution builds

### ML Pipeline Generated Outputs
```
outputs/
├── models/*.pkl           [EXCLUDED]
├── metrics/*.json         [EXCLUDED]
├── metrics/*.txt          [EXCLUDED]
└── figures/*.png          [EXCLUDED]

data/
├── processed/*.csv        [EXCLUDED]
└── predictions/*.csv      [EXCLUDED]
```

**Rationale:** These are generated at runtime and can be recreated by running the pipeline. Tracking them wastes storage and creates merge conflicts.

### IDE & Editor Files
- `.vscode/` - VS Code settings
- `.idea/` - JetBrains IDE settings
- `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*~` - Editor temporary files
- `.sublime-project`, `.sublime-workspace` - Sublime Text
- `.emacs*`, `.vim/` - Emacs/Vim configs

**Rationale:** IDE configs are personal and shouldn't be forced on other team members.

### Testing & Coverage
- `.pytest_cache/` - Pytest cache
- `.coverage` - Coverage reports
- `htmlcov/` - HTML coverage reports
- `.tox/` - Tox testing directories

**Rationale:** Generated during testing and can be recreated.

### Jupyter Notebooks
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` - Notebook backups
- `~*.ipynb` - Backup notebook files

**Rationale:** Auto-generated by Jupyter; recreated when notebook is opened.

### Logs & Temporary Files
- `*.log` - Application logs
- `*.tmp`, `*.temp` - Temporary files
- `*.bak`, `*.backup` - Backup files
- `logs/`, `tmp/`, `temp/` - Temporary directories

**Rationale:** Generated during execution and debugging; not needed for reproducibility.

### Sensitive & Environment Files
- `.env`, `.env.local` - Environment variables
- `secrets.json`, `credentials.json` - API keys, credentials
- `config.local.py`, `settings.local.py` - Local configuration

**Rationale:** Security risk; should never be committed to version control.

### OS-Specific Files
- `.DS_Store` - macOS metadata
- `Thumbs.db` - Windows thumbnail cache
- `.windows-terminal-state.json` - Windows Terminal config
- `desktop.ini` - Windows folder icons

**Rationale:** Machine-specific files that differ per OS/user.

### Package Management
- `uv.lock` - UV lockfile (optional - not tracked by default)
- `pip-log.txt` - Pip installation logs

**Rationale:** Can be regenerated from `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.

## What's INCLUDED (Do Track)

### Source Code
```
src/
├── __init__.py           [TRACKED]
├── config.py             [TRACKED]
├── data_loader.py        [TRACKED]
├── preprocessor.py       [TRACKED]
├── models.py             [TRACKED]
├── trainer.py            [TRACKED]
├── evaluator.py          [TRACKED]
└── utils.py              [TRACKED]
```

All Python modules are tracked because they contain the core pipeline logic.

### Notebooks
```
notebooks/
└── 05_main_pipeline.ipynb    [TRACKED]
```

Original notebooks are tracked; checkpoint backups are ignored.

### Documentation
```
docs/
├── PIPELINE_DOCUMENTATION.md [TRACKED]
├── IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md      [TRACKED]
├── RESULTS_ANALYSIS.md        [TRACKED]
└── GITIGNORE_GUIDE.md         [TRACKED]
```

Documentation is tracked for knowledge sharing and reference.

### Configuration Files
- `README.md` [TRACKED]
- `pyproject.toml` [TRACKED]
- `requirements.txt` [TRACKED]
- `.python-version` [TRACKED]
- `.gitignore` [TRACKED]
- `LICENSE` [TRACKED]

These define project metadata, dependencies, and structure.

### Data
```
data/
├── raw/
│   └── FINAL_DISSERTATION_DATASET_ENRICHED.csv  [TRACKED]
├── processed/                                     [IGNORED]
└── predictions/                                   [IGNORED]
```

Raw dataset is tracked for reproducibility. Processed data can be regenerated by running the pipeline.

### Git Configuration
- `.github/` [TRACKED if it exists]
- `.gitkeep` [TRACKED to preserve empty directories]

---

## Rationale for Key Decisions

### 1. Don't Track Outputs
**Why?**
- Models are large (546 KB random forest, 130 KB XGBoost)
- Metrics are deterministic (regenerated from code + data)
- Figures change frequently with data or model tweaks
- Repository bloat wastes storage and bandwidth
- Everyone can regenerate identical outputs locally

**How to Share Results:**
- Run pipeline locally and share results via email/messaging
- Document results in text format (metrics in JSON/TXT)
- Use results documents (RESULTS_ANALYSIS.md) instead of raw files

### 2. Don't Track Generated Data
**Why?**
- Processed splits are deterministic (same random seed)
- Can be perfectly reproduced with `run_pipeline.py`
- Saves storage for 686+172 training/test samples per dataset

**Reproducibility:**
```bash
python run_pipeline.py  # Regenerates train/test/metrics/figures
```

### 3. Do Track Raw Data
**Why?**
- Ensures exact reproducibility
- Guarantees all team members use identical input
- Prevents "version skew" where different inputs are used

**Storage Consideration:**
- CSV is only 1.6 MB (minimal storage impact)
- Small enough to track without issues

### 4. Don't Track Virtual Environments
**Why?**
- `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` define all dependencies
- Each team member uses their own isolated environment
- Size waste: venv directories are 100+ MB

**Reproduction:**
```bash
uv sync          # Creates fresh environment from pyproject.toml
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Alternative with pip
```

### 5. Don't Track IDE Configs
**Why?**
- Different team members use different IDEs/editors
- Personal preferences vary (.vscode/ settings, .idea/ JetBrains settings)
- Can cause merge conflicts

**Best Practice:**
- Use `.editorconfig` for basic formatting (not created yet, but recommended)
- Each developer configures their own IDE

---

## How to Use This .gitignore

### Checking What's Tracked
```bash
git ls-files
```
Shows all tracked files. Should include:
- All src/*.py files
- All docs/*.md files
- pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, README.md
- data/raw/*.csv

Should NOT include:
- outputs/ files
- data/processed/ files
- __pycache__/ directories
- .venv/ directories

### Adding Files Manually
If you need to track a file that matches an exclusion pattern:
```bash
git add -f path/to/file.ext
```

The `-f` flag forces tracking of ignored files (use sparingly).

### Verifying Ignore Rules
```bash
git check-ignore -v outputs/models/xgboost_model.pkl
```

Shows which rule is excluding a file.

## Environment-Specific Configurations

### For Different Operating Systems

**macOS Users:**
- .DS_Store is auto-ignored
- Use `.editorconfig` to maintain Unix line endings

**Windows Users:**
- Thumbs.db is auto-ignored
- Consider `git config core.safecrlf true`

**Linux Users:**
- Generally compatible with defaults
- Use consistent line endings (LF preferred)

### For Different IDEs

**VS Code Users:**
- .vscode/ is auto-ignored
- Install extensions locally; settings are ignored

**PyCharm/JetBrains Users:**
- .idea/ is auto-ignored
- No shared IDE configurations

**Sublime Text Users:**
- *.sublime-project is auto-ignored
- *.sublime-workspace is auto-ignored

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Accidentally Committing Secrets
```bash
# BAD: Commits .env file
git add .

# GOOD: Check .gitignore covers .env
git add src/ docs/
```

### 2. Committing Notebook Checkpoints
```bash
# These are auto-ignored
.ipynb_checkpoints/
~*.ipynb
```

### 3. Large Model Files
```bash
# Models are ignored
outputs/models/*.pkl
```

If you accidentally commit a large file:
```bash
git rm --cached large_file.pkl
git commit -m "Remove large model file from tracking"
```

---

## Adding to .gitignore Later

If you discover files that should be ignored:

1. **Add the pattern** to `.gitignore`
2. **Remove from git tracking:**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached path/to/file
   git commit -m "Stop tracking file"
   ```
3. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   git check-ignore -v path/to/file
   ```

---

## Repository Size Management

### Check Repository Size
```bash
du -sh .git
```

### Files Contributing Most
```bash
git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | xargs -n1 du -sh
```

### Ideal Repository Structure
```
Expected Size: ~2-5 MB (with raw CSV data)
├── Source code:     ~200 KB
├── Documentation:   ~500 KB
├── Raw data:        ~1.6 MB
├── Config files:    ~50 KB
└── .git directory:  ~1 MB
```

---

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying to production:

1. **Models are NOT in repo** - Download from model server/storage
2. **Generate outputs locally** - Run pipeline in production environment
3. **Use secrets management** - Don't store .env files
4. **Version the code** - Track source code only

---

## Summary

### What to Track
✓ Source code (src/*.py)
✓ Notebooks (original .ipynb files)
✓ Documentation (*.md files)
✓ Configuration (pyproject.toml, requirements.txt)
✓ Raw data (data/raw/*.csv)

### What to Ignore
✗ Generated outputs (models, metrics, figures)
✗ Processed data (can be regenerated)
✗ Cache files (__pycache__, .jupyter)
✗ IDE configurations (.vscode, .idea)
✗ Secrets and credentials (.env, secrets.json)
✗ OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
✗ Virtual environments (venv, .venv)

This approach keeps the repository:
- **Clean** - Only essential files tracked
- **Lightweight** - Minimal storage requirements
- **Shareable** - Easy to clone and run anywhere
- **Reproducible** - Raw data ensures identical inputs
- **Secure** - Secrets are never committed
